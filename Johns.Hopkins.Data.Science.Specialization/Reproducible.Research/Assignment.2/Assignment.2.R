#Does the document have a title that briefly summarizes the data analysis?
#1 -3 figures
#Does the analysis start from the raw data file (i.e. the original .csv.bz2 file)?
#Does the analysis address the question of which types of events are most harmful to population health?
#Does the analysis address the question of which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
#Do all the results of the analysis (i.e. figures, tables, numerical summaries) appear to be reproducible?
#Do the figure(s) have descriptive captions (i.e. there is a description near the figure of what is happening in the figure)?

#QUESTIONS

#Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the \color{red}{\verb|EVTYPE|}EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
#Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

#You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. 
#In general, you should ensure that \color{red}{\verb|echo = TRUE|}echo=TRUE for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).
