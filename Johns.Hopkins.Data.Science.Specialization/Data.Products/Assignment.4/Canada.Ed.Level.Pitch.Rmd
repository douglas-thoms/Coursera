## Data

Data source is Canada's 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016 and accessed
using the R package cancensus API features.

The percentage of population was calculated with the following formula:  

```{r include = FALSE}
library(cancensus)
library(sf)
        options(cancensus.api_key = 
                        "CensusMapper_7dd2122753cfb78fec890b61d909bdc4")
        options(cancensus.cache_path = getwd())
```

```{r echo = TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
                census_data <- get_census(dataset='CA16', regions=list(C="01"), 
                                          labels = "short", 
                                          vectors="v_CA16_5051", level="PR", 
                                          geo_format='sf')
```


## Sample of Data


<div class='pre-scrolly'>
```{r echo = TRUE,eval=TRUE}
summary(census_data)
```
</div>


## Calcuation and App Function

The output is calculated as follows:

$edu.lvl.per = (pop.with.specific.edu.lvl / area.pop) * 100$

So, if 10 people's highest education level is a bachelor's degree and the area population is 100, then 10% of the population highest education is a bachelor's degree.
